<h1>The Pass Vault</h1>
ThePassVault is a password management software created by 4 students. We implemented this to learn about industry standard practices for storing and retrieving encrypted passwords. <br />

<br> Even though school is over we still plan on fixing this up and making it look better and hopefully releasing it for others to use <br />
